# Weather-app
This is my first node app ..A weather application
Used API from Dark Sky net and from map box
Map box was used to generate the longitude and latitude of a given place (Douala,Boston,Philadelphia);
Dark Sky api was used to produce the weather forecast
Npm mpackages included express ,request and hbs as main dependencies and nodemon as development dependecy
Thinking about further updates
